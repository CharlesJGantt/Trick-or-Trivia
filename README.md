# Trick-or-Trivia v2.0 Author: Kristian Brasel
CharlesJGantt did a great job with v1.0, I expanded on it as rapidly as I could in the weeks leading up to Halloween 2017. It has a few asthetic issues that need to be ironed out, but I think I'll save that for next Halloween. I plan on making a youtube video explaining my additions, and showing off my finished product, I'll add a link here when I do. I work at a tutoring center teaching programming to kids grades 1-8 and this was a hit at the Halloween party, thanks Charles.
I used the Raspberry pi 7 inch touchscreen on a rpi 3 rev b running raspbian.
